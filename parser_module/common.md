### Summary 
The `common.py` file provides foundational structures and utilities for the CGIF and CL parsers. It contains essential classes and definitions that support parsing, error handling, and processing results. These components serve as the backbone for enabling semantic and syntactic analysis in the shared `parser.py` file.

### Main Components of `common.py`

1. **Classes**
   - **`Node`:**
     - Represents Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) nodes used to structure parsed expressions.
     - Attributes:
       - `node_type`: Type of the node (e.g., `CONCEPT`, `RELATION`).
       - `value`: Value or data stored in the node.
       - `children`: List of child nodes (default is an empty list).
       - `position`: Source position (line, column) for error tracing or debugging.
     - The `__repr__` method provides a summary of the node's type, value, and number of children.

   - **`Error`:**
     - Represents syntax or semantic errors encountered during parsing or validation.
     - Attributes:
       - `error_type`: Error category (e.g., `SYNTAX`, `SEMANTIC`).
       - `message`: Descriptive error message.
       - `position`: Location in the input text (line, column).
       - `suggestions`: Optional corrections or recommendations.
     - The `__repr__` method formats the error information for display.

   - **`ProcessingResult`:**
     - Encapsulates the result of processing input expressions.
     - Attributes:
       - `success`: Boolean indicating whether processing was successful.
       - `ast`: Abstract Syntax Tree generated during successful parsing.
       - `errors`: List of errors if processing fails.
       - `output_text`: Optional formatted output text.
       - `latex_code`: Optional generated LaTeX representation of the expression.
     - The `__repr__` method summarizes result data, including success state, AST details, or errors.

2. **Constants**
   - **Node Types:** Constants defining types of AST nodes:
     - `NODE_CONCEPT`: Represents conceptual entities.
     - `NODE_RELATION`: Represents relations between concepts.
     - `NODE_QUANTIFIER`: Quantifiers such as existential or universal.
     - `NODE_CONTEXT`: Represents contexts or scopes in expressions.
     - `NODE_NEGATION`: Represents negations.
     - `NODE_FUNCTION`: Functions within logical formulation.
     - `NODE_COREFERENCE`: Co-reference links (e.g., elements referring to the same entity).

   - **Error Types:** Categories of errors encountered:
     - `ERROR_SYNTAX`: Syntax-related errors.
     - `ERROR_SEMANTIC`: Semantic issues in input logic.
     - `ERROR_REFERENCE`: Errors related to undefined or invalid references.

   - **Quantifier Types:** Definitions for logical quantifiers:
     - `QUANTIFIER_EXISTENTIAL`: Existential quantifier (e.g., "There exists").
     - `QUANTIFIER_UNIVERSAL`: Universal quantifier (e.g., "For all").

### Role in the Parsing Process
The `common.py` module establishes reusable structures that interact seamlessly with the components in `parser.py`. Here is how the classes support the parsing process:
1. **`Node`:**
   - Integral to AST generation during parsing in `CGIFParser` and `CLParser`.
   - Organizes structured representations of expressions for validation or error handling.

2. **`Error`:**
   - Used by error handlers (`CGIFErrorHandler` and `CLErrorHandler`) to encapsulate and report issues.
   - Enables meaningful suggestions for correcting syntax or semantic mistakes.

3. **`ProcessingResult`:**
   - Central to returning outcomes from methods like `parse_cgif()` and `parse_cl()` in `parser.py`.
   - Distinguishes between successful parsing (producing an `ast`) and failures (producing `errors`).

### Strengths of the Code in This File
- **Reusability:** Modular definitions make the structures usable across CGIF and CL-specific parsing.
- **Flexibility:** Classes are versatile, supporting diverse parsing outcomes (successful or error-driven).
- **Readability:** The `__repr__` methods improve debugability and human readability.

### Next Steps
You can share additional files that implement the specific parsers (`CGIFParser`, `CLParser`) or validators (`CGIFValidator`, `CLValidator`). This will allow me to provide deeper insights into how these foundational structures are utilized across the system.
